## 🧾 Overview
The **Mini Banking App** is a web-based banking management system developed using **Java**, **JSP**, and **Servlets**.  
It enables users to securely log in using **Google OAuth 2.0**, manage their bank accounts, and perform transactions online.  
The app runs on **Apache Tomcat Server** and stores data in a **MySQL** database.  
It is built as a **Dynamic Web Project** using **Eclipse IDE**.

- Admins can view user data, manage banks, and perform administrative operations.

### 6. User-Friendly Interface
- Responsive and modern design using **Bootstrap**.
- Easy navigation between Home, Profile, MyBanks, and Transaction pages.
- Clean layout with properly linked JSP pages and servlets.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for web structure and styling.  
- **JSP (Java Server Pages)** for generating dynamic content.  
- **Bootstrap** for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Backend
- **Java Servlets** handle business logic and backend processing.  
- **JSP** integrated with Servlets for dynamic page rendering.  
- **Session Handling** for user authentication and state management.

### Authentication
- **Google OAuth 2.0** used for secure login through Google accounts.  
- **GoogleCallbackServlet** and **GoogleLoginServlet** handle OAuth flow and token verification.

### Database
- **MySQL** database stores user details, bank accounts, and transactions.  
- JDBC used to connect Servlets with MySQL for CRUD operations.  
- Database tables manage users, admins, accounts, and transaction logs.

### Server
- **Apache Tomcat 9.0** acts as the web server for deployment and testing.

### Tools & Build
- **Eclipse IDE** for development as a **Dynamic Web Project**.  
- **Manual Build / WAR Export** used for deploying to Tomcat.

## ⚡ How It Works
1. User visits the **Login.jsp** page and signs in using **Google OAuth**.  
2. On successful login, the **GoogleCallbackServlet** verifies and fetches user details.  
3. The user is redirected to the **Home.jsp** or **Dashboard** page.  
4. The app loads linked bank accounts using **BankListServlet**.  
5. The user can perform transactions such as deposit, transfer, or withdrawal.  
6. Transaction history and profile updates are managed through JSP pages and backend Servlets.
