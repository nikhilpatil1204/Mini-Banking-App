# Mini Banking App

The Mini Banking App is a web-based banking management system built using Java, JSP, and Servlets. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as viewing account details, checking balances, and managing transactions.
The project also integrates Google OAuth Login and connects to a backend server to fetch bank data dynamically.
